        Those  days,  the  Third  Age  of  Middle-earth,  are  now  long
        past,  and  the  shape  of  all  lands  has  been  changed;  but  the
        regions  in  which  Hobbits  then  lived  were  doubtless  the  same
        as  those  in  which  they  still  linger:  the  North-West  of  the  Old
        World,  east  of  the  Sea.  Of  their  original  home  the  Hobbits
        in  Bilbo’s  time  preserved  no  knowledge.  A  love  of  learning
        (other  than  genealogical  lore)  was  far  from  general  among
        them,  but  there  remained  still  a  few  in  the  older  families  who
        studied  their  own  books,  and  even  gathered  reports  of  old
        times  and  distant  lands  from  Elves,  Dwarves,  and  Men.  Their
        own  records  began  only  after  the  settlement  of  the  Shire,  and
        their  most  ancient  legends  hardly  looked  further  back  than
        their  Wandering  Days.  It  is  clear,  nonetheless,  from  these
        legends,  and  from  the  evidence  of  their  peculiar  words  and
        customs,  that  like  many  other  folk  Hobbits  had  in  the  distant
        past  moved  westward.  Their  earliest  tales  seem  to  glimpse  a
        time  when  they  dwelt  in  the  upper  vales  of  Anduin,  between
        the  eaves  of  Greenwood  the  Great  and  the  Misty  Mountains.
        Why  they  later  undertook  the  hard  and  perilous  crossing  of
        the  mountains  into  Eriador  is  no  longer  certain.  Their  own
        accounts  speak  of  the  multiplying  of  Men  in  the  land,  and  of a  shadow  that  fell  on  the  forest,  so  that  it  became  darkened
        and  its  new  name  was  Mirkwood.
        <br />
        <br />
        Before  the  crossing  of  the  mountains  the  Hobbits  had
        already  become  divided  into  three  somewhat  different  breeds:
        Harfoots,  Stoors,  and  Fallohides.  The  Harfoots  were  browner
        of  skin,  smaller,  and  shorter,  and  they  were  beardless  and
        bootless;  their  hands  and  feet  were  neat  and  nimble;  and  they
        preferred  highlands  and  hillsides.  The  Stoors  were  broader,
        heavier  in  build;  their  feet  and  hands  were  larger;  and  they
        preferred  flat  lands  and  riversides.  The  Fallohides  were  fairer
        of  skin  and  also  of  hair,  and  they  were  taller  and  slimmer
        than  the  others;  they  were  lovers  of  trees  and  of  woodlands.
        <br />
        <br />
        The  Harfoots  had  much  to  do  with  Dwarves  in  ancient
        times,  and  long  lived  in  the  foothills  of  the  mountains.  They
        moved  westward  early,  and  roamed  over  Eriador  as  far  as
        Weathertop  while  the  others  were  still  in  Wilderland.  They
        were  the  most  normal  and  representative  variety  of  Hobbit,
        and  far  the  most  numerous.  They  were  the  most  inclined  to
        settle  in  one  place,  and  longest  preserved  their  ancestral  habit
        of  living  in  tunnels  and  holes.
        <br />
        <br />
        The  Stoors  lingered  long  by  the  banks  of  the  Great  River
        Anduin,  and  were  less  shy  of  Men.  They  came  west  after  the
        Harfoots  and  followed  the  course  of  the  Loudwater  south¬
        wards;  and  there  many  of  them  long  dwelt  between  Tharbad
        and  the  borders  of  Dunland  before  they  moved  north  again.
        <br />
        <br />
        The  Fallohides,  the  least  numerous,  were  a  northerly
        branch.  They  were  more  friendly  with  Elves  than  the  other
        Hobbits  were,  and  had  more  skill  in  language  and  song  than
        in  handicrafts;  and  of  old  they  preferred  hunting  to  tilling.
        They  crossed  the  mountains  north  of  Rivendell  and  came
        down  the  River  Hoarwell.  In  Eriador  they  soon  mingled  with
        the  other  kinds  that  had  preceded  them,  but  being  somewhat
        bolder  and  more  adventurous,  they  were  often  found  as
        leaders  or  chieftains  among  clans  of  Harfoots  or  Stoors.  Even
        in  Bilbo’s  time  the  strong  Fallohidish  strain  could  still  be
        noted  among  the  greater  families,  such  as  the  Tooks  and  the
        Masters  of  Buckland. In  the  westlands  of  Eriador,  between  the  Misty  Mountains
        and  the  Mountains  of  Lune,  the  Hobbits  found  both  Men  and
        Elves.  Indeed,  a  remnant  still  dwelt  there  of  the  Dunedain,  the
        kings  of  Men  that  came  over  the  Sea  out  of  Westernesse;  but
        they  were  dwindling  fast  and  the  lands  of  their  North  King¬
        dom  were  falling  far  and  wide  into  waste.  There  was  room
        and  to  spare  for  incomers,  and  ere  long  the  Hobbits  began
        to  settle  in  ordered  communities.  Most  of  their  earlier  settle¬
        ments  had  long  disappeared  and  been  forgotten  in  Bilbo’s
        time;  but  one  of  the  first  to  become  important  still  endured,
        though  reduced  in  size;  this  was  at  Bree  and  in  the  Chetwood
        that  lay  round  about,  some  forty  miles  east  of  the  Shire.
        <br />
        <br />
        It  was  in  these  early  days,  doubtless,  that  the  Hobbits
        learned  their  letters  and  began  to  write  after  the  manner  of
        the  Dunedain,  who  had  in  their  turn  long  before  learned  the
        art  from  the  Elves.  And  in  those  days  also  they  forgot  what¬
        ever  languages  they  had  used  before,  and  spoke  ever  after  the
        Common  Speech,  the  Westron  as  it  was  named,  that  was
        current  through  all  the  lands  of  the  kings  from  Arnor  to
        Gondor,  and  about  all  the  coasts  of  the  Sea  from  Belfalas  to
        Lune.  Yet  they  kept  a  few  words  of  their  own,  as  well  as  their
        own  names  of  months  and  days,  and  a  great  store  of  personal
        names  out  of  the  past.
        <br />
        <br />
        About  this  time  legend  among  the  Hobbits  first  becomes
        history  with  a  reckoning  of  years.  For  it  was  in  the  one  thou¬
        sand  six  hundred  and  first  year  of  the  Third  Age  that  the
        Fallohide  brothers,  Marcho  and  Blanco,  set  out  from  Bree;
        and  having  obtained  permission  from  the  high  king  at
        Fornost,*  they  crossed  the  brown  river  Baranduin  with  a
        great  following  of  Hobbits.  They  passed  over  the  Bridge  of
        Stonebows,  that  had  been  built  in  the  days  of  the  power  of
        the  North  Kingdom,  and  they  took  all  the  land  beyond  to
        dwell  in,  between  the  river  and  the  Far  Downs.  All  that  was
        <br />
        <br />
        *  As  the  records  of  Gondor  relate  this  was  Argeleb  II,  the  twentieth
        of  the  Northern  line,  which  came  to  an  end  with  Arvedui  three  hundred
        years  later. demanded  of  them  was  that  they  should  keep  the  Great
        Bridge  in  repair,  and  all  other  bridges  and  roads,  speed  the
        king’s  messengers,  and  acknowledge  his  lordship.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thus  began  the  Shire-reckoning ,  for  the  year  of  the  crossing
        of  the  Brandywine  (as  the  Hobbits  turned  the  name)  became
        Year  One  of  the  Shire,  and  all  later  dates  were  reckoned  from
        it.*  At  once  the  western  Hobbits  fell  in  love  with  their  new
        land,  and  they  remained  there,  and  soon  passed  once  more
        out  of  the  history  of  Men  and  of  Elves.  While  there  was  still
        a  king  they  were  in  name  his  subjects,  but  they  were,  in  fact,
        ruled  by  their  own  chieftains  and  meddled  not  at  all  with
        events  in  the  world  outside.  To  the  last  battle  at  Fornost  with
        the  Witch-lord  of  Angmar  they  sent  some  bowmen  to  the  aid
        of  the  king,  or  so  they  maintained,  though  no  tales  of  Men
        record  it.  But  in  that  war  the  North  Kingdom  ended;  and
        then  the  Hobbits  took  the  land  for  their  own,  and  they  chose
        from  their  own  chiefs  a  Thain  to  hold  the  authority  of  the
        king  that  was  gone.  There  for  a  thousand  years  they  were
        little  troubled  by  wars,  and  they  prospered  and  multiplied
        after  the  Dark  Plague  (S.R.  37)  until  the  disaster  of  the  Long
        Winter  and  the  famine  that  followed  it.  Many  thousands  then
        perished,  but  the  Days  of  Dearth  (1158-60)  were  at  the  time
        of  this  tale  long  past  and  the  Hobbits  had  again  become
        accustomed  to  plenty.  The  land  was  rich  and  kindly,  and
        though  it  had  long  been  deserted  when  they  entered  it,  it  had
        before  been  well  tilled,  and  there  the  king  had  once  had  many
        farms,  cornlands,  vineyards,  and  woods.
